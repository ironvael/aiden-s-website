# AidenHovren.com

Personal website and digital hub for **Aiden Hovren** — a systems-oriented operator building companies, tools, and infrastructure across technology, operations, and education.

This site is not a résumé replacement or a marketing funnel.  
It’s a living system: part portfolio, part sandbox, part public notebook.

## Purpose

AidenHovren.com exists to:

- Demonstrate real, hands-on web development and systems thinking  
- Centralize projects, ventures, and long-term work  
- Build credibility through execution, not credentials  
- Serve as a foundation for future products, writing, and experiments  

No personal brand theater. No buzzword soup. Just work, shipped.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Projects & Ventures**  
  Active companies, experiments, and ideas in progress

- **Writing & Thinking**  
  Long-term thinking, systems design, and lessons learned building things

- **Technical Demos**  
  Interactive UI elements, animations, and front-end experiments

- **Background**  
  A concise overview of experience across operations, engineering, and leadership

This site is intentionally opinionated and evolving.

## Tech Stack

This site is built with modern, scalable tooling:

- **Framework:** React / Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Design Philosophy:** Clean, functional, minimal — form follows intent

The stack may evolve. The goal is clarity and performance, not trend-chasing.

## Design Principles

- Systems over aesthetics  
- Motion with purpose  
- Minimal but not sterile  
- Fast, readable, and resilient  
- Interactive where it adds signal  

Every element should earn its place.

---

## Status

This is an **active, evolving project**.

Expect:
- Ongoing visual refinements  
- New sections and experiments  
- Occasional breaking changes  
- Incomplete ideas living publicly  

Stability is less important than momentum.
